## Description ## 

A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.

## Notes ##

I'm re-using the same code that was done for CartPole-v0 using DQN to learn the solution.
